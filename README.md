# Sequential models for classification tasks based on Neural Production Systems principle

This work is based on previous work introducing the [Neural Production Systems](https://github.com/anirudh9119/neural_production_systems) from the paper [Neural Production Systems: Learning Rule-Governed Visual Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01937).
